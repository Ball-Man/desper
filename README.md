# desper
A Python3 game development toolkit, based on open source projects.

## Project status
*(updated 2022-09-24)*
The version you're seeing is an early alpha of the library. Docstrings are ready for documentation generation (sphinx)
but proper explanation on how to easily setup a project would be missing.

I am currently working on a refurbished version, that will be labeled 1.0.0. Using this version of the library on a real project. Progress can be monitored from [the 1.0.0 project page](https://github.com/Ball-Man/desper/projects/4). Development is being carried out on a [dedicated branch](https://github.com/Ball-Man/desper/tree/1.0.0-devel) that will be merged into master restoring a trunk based workflow.

The library in action:
* current project, closed source: [Lone Planet](https://fmistri.it/lone/index.html)
* android experiment, open source: [monospace](https://github.com/Ball-Man/monospace)
