# desper
A Python3 game development toolkit, based on open source projects.

## Project status
The version you're seeing is an early alpha of the library. Docstrings are ready for documentation generation (sphinx)
but proper explanation on how to easily setup a project would be missing.


For this reason(s) (and a bunch of technical issues with the current version) I'll begin development of
a refurbished and stable release as soon as possible (that will come with the necessary documentation).
Until that day, I'll be using this alpha version in real projects in order to gather information on
how to improve it.
