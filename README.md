# desper
A Python3 game development toolkit for resource and logic management.
Meant to be used coupled with open source projects.

## Project status
*(updated 2022-11-16)*
The version you're seeing is a beta of desper's 1.0 core. While in principle
all designed features are implemented (and the code is decently
documented) some testing is still needed before declaring it stable.
In particular, empirical testing, i.e. real case usage.

Moreover, the main graphics module (a bridge module to the pyglet
library) is still missing and will be implemented in the near future,
probably on a separate repository.

A user manual is also in the making.

Meanwhile, take a look at the library (alpha version) in action on
existing problems:
* current project, closed source: [Lone Planet](https://fmistri.it/lone/index.html)
* android experiment, open source: [monospace](https://github.com/Ball-Man/monospace)
