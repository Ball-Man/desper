Entries are numerated in order to reference them easily, but the order doesn't necessary depend on importance.

Core:
  01 - Manage paths with pathlib instead of os.path(?) (this will reflect on other modules probably)
  02 - Deactivator
  03 - Refine logic for importer functions(the location now is checked with a simple `in` statement, should check if it's a specific directory name in the
  patch instead)

Glet:
  01 - Improve event handler decorator (e.g. accept arguments to specify which handlers the class should handle, passing those arguments to window.push_handlers(...))
