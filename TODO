Core:
  01 - Manage paths with pathlib instead of os.path(?) (this will reflect on other modules probably)
  02 - Builder for importer_dicts(gof)
  03 - Add a feature to AbstractWorld that calls an on_attach method on newly added components(if the interface is implemented). The interface might be called OnAttachListener.
